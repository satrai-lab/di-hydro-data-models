This repository serves as the **main directory** for the IoT-enhanced NGSI-LD data models tailored for context-aware hydropower plants. The data models are actively **updated with new incubated files**, ensuring they evolve with emerging standards and technological advancements.

These data models are developed as part of the **Di-Hydro Project**, an initiative aimed at revolutionizing hydropower plant operations with advanced digital tools and IoT technologies.

## Project Overview & Mission

**Di-Hydro** is a European-funded project committed to advancing the potential of hydropower (HP) plants and clusters in alignment with the ambitious goals of the **European Green Deal** and the **Paris Agreement**.

The mission of Di-Hydro is to revolutionize how hydropower plants operate, making them smarter, more efficient, and environmentally conscious. The project focuses on the development of cutting-edge digital and smart decision-making tools for hydropower plants, regardless of their digitization level, to ensure they play a pivotal role in a greener, more sustainable future.

### Vision

At Di-Hydro, our vision is to empower sustainable energy production by enabling hydropower plants to adopt next-generation IoT technologies and data models. This transformation will allow hydropower plants to increase efficiency, reduce their environmental footprint, and contribute to the broader goals of the European energy transition.

## Data Models

The data models in this repository are designed to capture the diverse structural and operational components of hydropower plants. They include both static properties (such as physical structures) and dynamic properties (such as real-time sensor data) to provide a comprehensive digital representation of hydropower plants.

For details on the specific NGSI-LD models, visit the appropriate folders:
- **[Static Models Folder](./static)**: Contains models for the structural components of hydropower plants (e.g., dams, turbines, generators).
- **[Dynamic Models Folder](./dynamic)**: Contains models for real-time sensor data and operational observations (e.g., water flow sensors, turbine efficiency).
